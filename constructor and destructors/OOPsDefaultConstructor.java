
// Default Constructor
/*
Basically, the purpose of the default constructor is to provide the default values to the
objects like null, 0, etc. according to the type.
*/

// Basic Important Key Points Related To Constructor Always Remember.
/*
1.A constructorâ€™s name must be exactly the same as the name of its class.
2.The constructor is a special method because it does not have a return type. We
do not even need to write void as the return type
*/

// NOTE:constructor is called as soon as the object is created as constructor initializes the object.
